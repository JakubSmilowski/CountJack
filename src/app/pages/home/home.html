      <h2>What is Basic Strategy?</h2>
      <p>
        Basic strategy is the mathematically best way to play every hand in Blackjack. It takes into account your cards and the dealer's upcard to minimize the house edge. Memorizing this strategy will significantly improve your chances of winning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always hit on 12–16 if the dealer has 7–Ace.</li>
        <li>Always stand on 17 or more.</li>
        <li>Double down on 11 vs dealer 2–10.</li>
        <li>Split Aces and 8s, never split 10s or 5s.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introduction to Card Counting</h2>
      <p>
        Card counting helps you track high and low cards left in the deck. A common method is the Hi-Lo system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>+1 for cards 2 through 6</li>
        <li>0 for 7 through 9</li>
        <li>-1 for 10, J, Q, K, A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When your count is high, more high cards are left — that’s good for the player. Adjust your bets based on the count to increase profit.
